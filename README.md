# Digital Art Portfolio Project (First ever project)

### Description
This project serves as my final art portfolio for a 10th-grade class, required to showcase art projects completed in 2021. Instead of opting for a traditional PowerPoint, I proposed coding my portfolio using HTML/CSS. This decision allowed me to apply and showcase the technologies I was teaching myself at the time.
