        <p>
            After being inspired to do the self-portraits of me and my mother, I was inspired again by those same drawings, to do my Final Exam. I tried something different in each and everyone of my self-portraits. In my first self-portrait that I had to do for an assignment, I only drew the self-portrait and things that represented me in the background. Me and my mothers self-portrait, that I completed on my own time, I did the same thing I did for the assignment, but added in a background by coloring the entire page and little empty spaces. For the project I'm working on now, I'm going to do the same exact thing I did in the previous projects, but this time I'm going to only take up a small portion of the page, and have my sketch book turned horizontally instead of like the other ones.
